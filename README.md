SecureStack is a full-stack Kotlin Spring Boot application that helps development
teams stay secure and up-to-date by monitoring software tools and project dependencies for version updates.
It supports GitHub login, team-based organization, app-specific configuration,
and sends email alerts when newer versions are available‚Äîmaking dependency tracking simple,
proactive, and secure.

**SecureStack** is a full-stack **Kotlin Spring Boot app**:
* Uses **PostgreSQL** database for storing 
  * users and teams, 
  * teams software (for example Git, Java, IntelliJ, Kotlin)
  * applications and their software and Gradle/Maven dependencies for version updates
* Sends **email alerts** on new versions
* Uses **GitHub OAuth** for authentication
* Includes a **Thymeleaf** frontend, packaged with the backend
